			<h2>All about Terrariums</h2>
			
			<p>
				A terrarium is a sealed or open glass container that houses a miniature ecosystem. These small, self-contained gardens can be filled with a variety of plants, creating a lush, green environment that is easy to maintain and beautiful to look at.
			</p>

			<p>
				Terrariums can be divided into two main types: closed and open. Closed terrariums are perfect for plants that thrive in high humidity and low light, such as ferns, mosses, and air plants. The sealed environment allows for the recycling of water through condensation and evaporation, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.
			</p>

			<p>
				Creating a terrarium involves selecting the right container, choosing suitable plants, and layering materials such as gravel, activated charcoal, and potting soil to ensure proper drainage and prevent root rot. Once assembled, terrariums require minimal maintenance, making them an excellent choice for busy individuals or those new to gardening.
			</p>

			<p>
				Terrariums not only serve as a beautiful addition to any home or office but also offer a range of benefits. They can improve air quality, reduce stress, and provide a sense of connection to nature. With their compact size and captivating aesthetics, terrariums are a delightful way to bring the beauty of the outdoors inside.
